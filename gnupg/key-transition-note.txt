Hash: SHA512,SHA1



# Transition note, Aug 2nd, 2014

After 5 years of using my GPG key, it's time to replace it with a new one. The
old used a 1024-bit DSA key, which uses SHA-1; you may know that this algorithm
has been broken. Todays recommendations point to RSA with at least 3072 bit,
which is why I've created a RSA key with 4096 bits.

My old key will still be active till Oct. 31st, 2014 - I've edited it, to
expire after that time, and I will actively revoke it before that date. I'd
appreciated it, if you use the time to switch to the new key.

If you signed the old one and it is applicable with your policy, please also
sign my new key - this is highly appreciated.

My old key was:

    pub   1024D/402CB18E 2009-05-19 [expires: 2014-10-31]
          Key fingerprint = FFCF AF08 F714 F6C6 1436  8C47 4ACA 6F31 402C B18E
    uid                  Kannan Thambiah (Primary private address) <kannan.thambiah@gmail.com>
    uid                  pygospa (Online address) <pygospa@gmail.com>
    uid                  Kannan Thambiah (University department mail) <kth@informatik.uni-kiel.de>
    uid                  Kannan Thambiah <kth@informatik.uni-kiel.de>
    uid                  [jpeg image of size 8657]

The new key, I'm transitioning to:

    pub   4096R/6ADBD5B7 2014-08-01 [expires: 2016-07-31]
          Key fingerprint = F057 A0D6 CAC6 2E12 75EF  9E24 7C43 853E 6ADB D5B7
    uid                  Kannan Thambiah <kannan.thambiah@gmail.com>
    uid                  pygospa <pygospa@gmail.com>
    uid                  [jpeg image of size 81784]

I've left out university and department UIDs, because they will expire after
Sept. 30th. I also updated the photo UID to show a more recent picture that was
taken last year. Photo UIDs might be stripped by key servers, so if you want to
have it, use the key I exported and uploaded onto my blogs webspace.

    1. wget -q -O- http://pygospa.wordpress.com/
    2. gpg --recv-key 6ADBD5B7

You are free to use any key server, but I've uploaded it to the SKS-Key servers
and it might take some time till it's replicated with all servers. If it's not
available on your preferred server, please use that, buy issuing:

    gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key 6ADBD5B7

With my old key you can assure that these lines are  genuine by checking the
signatures on it; both my old and my new key will produce a valid signature to
assure you that these two keys belong together.

    gpg --verify gpg-transition-note.txt
    gpg --check-sigs 6ADBD5B7

If you trusted my old key, you now know that my new key should be genuine as
well. So if you signed the old one you can safely sign this key without
re-checking my identity. If you are still in doubt feel free to contact me on
any secure channel of your choice.

If you decide to sign my key:

    gpg --sign-key 6ADBD5B7

You'll then need to send it back to me. There are two ways - choose your
desired one: 

    1. Easiest for you: Just re-upload the key after signing it:
        
	gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-key 6ADBD5B7

    2. Send it to me via mail. Again, two possibilities:

      a. Create an attachment for me:

          gpg --armor --export 6ADBD5B7 > 6ADBD5B7-signed.key

      b. On *NIX-Systems with configured CLI mail tool, just issue:

          gpg --armor --export 6ADBD5B7 | mail -s 'I signed your new key' pygospa@gmail.com

If you have any further question, feel free to contact me. I'm sorry for any
inconvenience this might cause you.

Sincerely,

    Kannan Thambiah,
