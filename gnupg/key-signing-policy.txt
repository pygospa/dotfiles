# PGP Signature Policy

These are the policies according to which I will sign your key with my own key
[0x6ADBD5B7]. 

The purpose of a signature policy is to write down your own interpretation of
RFC2440, Section 5.2.1 "Signature Types", which defines four different
certification levels, 0x10, 0x11, 0x12 and 0x13 (commonly numbered in PGP user
interfaces from 0 to 3); this section states the general idea of how to use the
signature types (also referred to as "Certification Levels"), but it leaves room
for interpretation and to some it even contradicts the general idea of when
and how to sign a key.

It's a good idea to also base your trust on signature policies. Someone who
transparently declares when and how he signs a key, is probably trustworthier
(especially if his declarations are reasonable) than a signature by someone
where you don't know how it was signed.

My interpretation of the certification levels and how I use them, are as
follows:

0x10
	This level states, that the signatory doesn't want to give any statement
	on how thorough he verified the key and how sure he is about that
	person being who he is.

	I see no reason in keeping it a secret about how sure I am, that a
	person actually is who he states he is and the only time I cannot tell
	is when I didn't actually check. That totally counters the general idea
	of signing keys, so I'll *never* use this level

0x11
	This level states that you don't know the person and you didn't verify
	the identity, but you are still pretty certain that it is the person
	you suspect. 

	I understand "persona certification" as a third person, whom I deeply
	trust. This third person is absolutely certain, that the person in
	question is who he pretends to be. So only if someone I deeply trust
	assures me, that a person is who he is, and if additionally it is
	impossible for me to meet this person, will I use certification level
	1. I think this case will be highly improbable for me, so I'll hardly
	ever use this level.

0x12
	In the RFC2449 this level is called "Casual certification" while the
	next is "Substantial certification". 
	
	I don't know, how to "casually" check an ID of a person. If I issue
	this signature (this will be the majority of signatures), I will have
	looked at an officially issued ID, I will have checked that the ID
	looks genuine as thoroughly as possible, and I will also check the key
	fingerprint and email address before signing.

0x13
	To be able to create a "Substantial Certification", I would really have
	to know that the person is, who he says he is. This will be impossible
	with most persons, as everybody can just pretend to be someone they are
	not. I'm also no expert in detecting forged documents, etc.

	So this level is reserved for people that I believe to *really* know.
	This is true for people, with whom I grew up and knew my "whole life",
	so only long-time best friends and family will get a level three
	signature. 

There will be no exceptions to this policy so if you want a signature, and you
don't fall into the levels 0x11 or 0x13 you'll have to visit me with a valid ID
and present me your fingerprint and UID personally.

If applicable and reasonable, I will add a notation to the signature, stating
under which circumstances I verified your identity (e.g. if it happened on fairs,
conferences or key-signing parties).

You can verify the integrity and authentic of this document by calling

    gpg --verify key-signing-policy.txt

Sincerely,

    Kannan Thambiah
